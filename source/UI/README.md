# pygame-checkers
This is a simple game of checkers I made as an exercise to help me learn pygame. There is not much to it.
* X's and O's are used to represent the game pieces.
* Colors indicate whose turn it is and which piece is selected for movement.
* Point-and-click GUI interface is used to select pieces and move them.
* Console is used to display helpful messages like 'invalid move'

## Dependencies:
* Python 2.x
* A version of Pygame that runs on Python 2.x

## Instructions:
Once you have installed the correct dependencies, you should be able to run this program. Just clone the repository and
run 'python checkers.py' from the command line.
